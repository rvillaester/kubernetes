1. Empty will get reclaim immediately after the pod dies while hostpath remains
2. Hostpath will be created in each of the nodes where the pod is scheduled
3. Each node will have different files in the host path, the solution is to create an NFS mounted to each of the nodes and host that as the mount point for the hostpath.
