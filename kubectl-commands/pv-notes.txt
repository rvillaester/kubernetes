Static Provisioning
    - the disk must be created first before it can be used
    - crate a PV object out of that disk
    - in GCP, the disk must be created on the same zone as the cluster
    - the PVC must match the PV
        - storage class
        - disk size <= to the PV

Dynamic Provisioning
    - The disk will be provisioned dynamically
    - Need to define a StorageClass object
